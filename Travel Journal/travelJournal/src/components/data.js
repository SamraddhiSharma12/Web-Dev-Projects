    placename: "Pangong Lake",
    placeinfo: "Pangong Tso (lake) is situated at a height of 14,270 ft above sea level and is said to be one of the highest brackish water lakes in the world. The lake is almost 5 km wide and 134 km long, with one-third of it lying in India and the other two-thirds in China. The beauty is adorned with furry milky clouds and the overlooking stern mountains making an artistic impression reflecting in the water. The lake is also a breeding ground for different types of birds during the summer season. Bar-headed geese, Brahminy ducks, black-necked cranes, and seagulls are commonly spotted here. The most gripping fact about this lake is that it changes color appearing blue, grey-green, and red at varied points in time. During winter, the lake freezes completely despite being saline water."

    placeinfo: "Covering roughly 40 percent of South America, including parts of Brazil, Peru, and Colombia, the Amazon is the largest rainforest on the planet, and home to more than 40,000 plant species and 1,300 bird species alone. But be sure to visit the winding rivers and diverse wildlife while you can—climate change (along with man-made fires) is increasingly whittling away the habitat every day."
